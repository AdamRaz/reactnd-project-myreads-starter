# react based reading list app - react book shelf

This is a react based app to keep track of a reading list: search for books, assign a book to a 'shelf' depending on whether you have read the book or want to read the book or are currently reading.

The selection of books is limited... this is just an example!

This is based on a udacity project assignment: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

navigate to an empty working directory, clone the project with `git clone <insert url here>`, then run `npm install` in parent project directory, then `npm start`, the app should open in your default browser.
